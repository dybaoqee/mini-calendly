# Mini Calendly - Repo similar to [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) 
Build a Calendar Slot Booking service, similar to that of Calendly, which allows people
to define their available slots on a day and other people to book them.

### Requirements - 
* You would need to create the backend APIs for this application.
* Create a basic user registration and authentication system.
* Create APIs using which a user can define their available slots for a particular day. Assume that each slot is a fixed hourly slot. For example, 12:00-13:00, 13:00-14:00, etc.
* Create APIs using which a user can book an available slot.
* Show an error response when an unauthenticated user is trying to access the APIs.


### To Do - 
- [ ] Check the case where same user id is registerd twice.
